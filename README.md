# Huffman-Coding-in-C
compile and run
     the template using these commands:

      $ gcc -o test testHuffman.c Huffman.c

      $ ./test Results/AThroughF-ASCII.txt

     In that test command, the argument is the name of the file
     for which the Huffman code should be created.

     You should see output similar to this:

$ time ./test Results/AThroughF-ASCII.txt 
100 characters, 800 fixed bits, -1 Huffman bits (0 bytes), ratio -0.0013.
